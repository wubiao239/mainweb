World Bank's efforts in the safety of gravel production



As we all know, the ore industry is one of the important basic industries in China, China's infrastructure construction, plays a decisive role. With the deepening of China's economic system reform and opening to the outside world, the rapid development of economy has promoted the rapid development of the ore industry, especially the small and medium-sized quarrying industry on the ore crushing, more unprecedented pace of vigorous development for the transportation industry, construction, The development of the tourism industry, the placement of rural surplus labor force, the promotion and maintenance of stability has made tremendous contributions.
China is one of the countries rich in ore resources, China's gravel production enterprises are widely distributed, almost all parts of the country have, the state through the visit, analysis of urban construction projects, the need for a large number of gravel materials, some with building materials Resources of the village committee or the villagers group will be a large number of quarries, but in a considerable part of the broken village and the villagers group, not according to scientific services, its resource reserves, geological safety, mining age and so on has never been demonstrated and planning, Launched, blind mining and broken. In the broken, the owner is not by technical specifications but by the so-called experience in the command operations, illegal operation and production, safety and labor protection measures are poor, depending on the life of the child for the play, money not life.
The main reason is because the gravel manufacturers point wide, county (district) level departments by personnel, equipment and system constraints, it is difficult to implement regular and effective supervision and management, the township government can not investigate and deal with, causing quarry safety Production regulatory loopholes. Co., Ltd. According to this situation, a large number of investment in R \u0026 D and production of various types of special broken ore and other hard material crusher, mainly: jaw crusher, impact crusher, impact crusher, European version of crusher, etc. Advanced technology, safe and reliable, is the preferred equipment for environmental crushing.
State-owned industry in the gravel production line of workers and manufacturers of the competent departments: broken work, adhere to the safety first, prevention first; adhere to the staff holders of certificates, training professionals; improve the automation of equipment, rational exploitation of broken ore The To be conducive to the development of China's ore, to promote the development of building materials industry.
