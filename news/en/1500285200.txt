Energy saving and environmental protection, the state of heavy industry gangue crusher energy saving and crushing machine a high efficiency



In recent years, with the rapid development of the global economy, the increasing demand for energy resources, but also on the survival of mankind's natural environment caused great harm and pressure, in order to protect the environment, for future generations to create a comfortable survival Environment, energy conservation and environmental protection concept in the world gradually become mainstream and continue to win the hearts of people, low-carbon environmental protection economy is becoming a new trend of social and economic development. As a domestic professional mine machinery and equipment crusher, milling machine, sand making machine and other equipment manufacturers, Shanghai World State Heavy Machinery Co., Ltd. (referred to as state state industry) that the new situation under the crusher industry is facing new opportunities and Challenges, in order to promote the harmonious coexistence between man and society and the development of environmental protection economy, transformation and innovation has become the only way for the crusher industry to obtain long-term development.
In the era of shortage of energy resources, any kind of energy resources should be the most efficient use of coal gangue is one of them. Coal gangue is a coal waste process and coal washing process emissions of solid waste, is a coal in the process of coal and associated with a low carbon content, harder than the black and gray rock. Coal gangue disposal is not used, occupy large tracts of land and the natural environment to generate great harm. The protection of the environment is China's basic national policy, with the national environmental law enforcement efforts continue to increase, people on the environmental quality requirements, to solve the problem of coal gangue pollution is more and more prominent, coal gangue power is to make full use of coal gangue effective heat Ingredients, turning waste into treasure, an effective way to solve pollution.
In view of the specific situation of coal gangue resources in China, and under the guidance of low-carbon economy, in the face of how the crusher will be improved to meet the needs of the current economic development and some other issues, the state of the industry for a serious analysis of the problem, The introduction of foreign advanced technology at the same time, in the development and production of crusher on technological innovation, improve the quality of crusher products at the same time efforts to change the mode of production, adhere to the intensive economic growth and to meet the diverse needs of market trends, adhere to the technology Oriented, continuous innovation and technology, and take the road of sustainable development, energy-saving environment-friendly crusher to become the company's main research object, the company has a variety of R \u0026 D market, energy-saving jaw crusher, impact crusher, cone crusher Equipment can be efficient crushing coal gangue, access to high-yield high-quality products, the industry highly praised, to promote the development of the entire industry and the recycling of coal gangue resources has played a huge role in promoting.
State-owned industry since its inception, after 15 years of wind and rain baptism, in the highly competitive market come to the fore, has now become a leader in the mining machinery industry. Its main success is to persevere in social science and information road, continue to innovate, to digital, intelligent, automation-based more advanced mining machinery to create favorable conditions. Looking to the future, the state will spare no effort to build a multi-win-win industry to contribute to the pattern, and 'stresses integrity, quality' concept, create a crusher industry's booming future, environmental protection for a low-carbon economy , To promote China's sustained and rapid economic development.
