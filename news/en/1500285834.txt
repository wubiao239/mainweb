Mine machinery market is good to grasp the opportunity to be creative



The same time as the above-

China's mining market has been coveted the object of foreign countries, a US newspaper recently also commented that the acquisition of Chinese enterprises in developed countries, mining, overseas mergers and acquisitions in 2008 is the culmination of China's growing opportunities for mergers and acquisitions and China's challenges The emergence of the trend created by the Shanghai World State Heavy Machinery Co., Ltd. professional manufacturing crusher, sand making machine, milling machine, crusher series: jaw crusher, cone crusher, vertical crusher and other mining machinery and equipment.


I rely on a strong R \u0026 D and production strength, has become a rare domestic broken, sand machinery export base.


In contrast, the road and large and medium-sized crusher market has been a large amount of these products are basically the basic use, and large and medium-sized crusher equipment utilization increased, the development of pavement industry to small crusher products flow quickly, The rapid development of large and medium-sized crusher equipment due to high-speed railway cost several times the conventional railway, so the railway construction on the road and large and medium-sized crusher equipment demand is higher, the annual large and medium-sized crusher also has nearly 1000 market demand, For the production of roadbed materials Raymond grinding This will inevitably lead to large and medium-sized crusher into mass production.


As we all know, China's crusher industry is promising, the investment environment is better. Therefore, many companies took the opportunity to enter the crusher market, resulting in mixed varieties of crusher, performance advantages and disadvantages vary, the quality is different, a direct impact on the crusher industry in the domestic and international development stage.


CBBC industry as a star of the mining machinery industry enterprises, as always, under the guidance of scientific and technological innovation, the development of new technologies to create more environmentally friendly energy efficient and more in line with the times and customer demand for the machine as the goal. Shanghai Shi Bang industry for the crusher common problems were analyzed, the organization of professional technical team to study the causes of the problem and its improvement methods, made a breakthrough. Not only makes the crusher performance, work efficiency, and independent innovation developed a new type of crusher equipment, opened up a new market in the international market, and get praise.
