Composite crusher in the construction of promising prospects



With the domestic real estate and high-speed construction of the road continue to develop, making the crusher industry has also been rapid development. Crusher production specifications from a single crusher to various specifications of the various types of crusher. The new crusher one of the complex crusher sales market has gradually developed, the sales of composite crusher is far more significant than in previous years to improve. The composite crusher has been widely used in the construction of expressway in China, and it has high yield compared with other types of crusher. The construction of the expressway requires a lot of gravel material, a single rely on outsourcing can not fundamentally solve the problem, so the composite crusher to provide adequate high-speed road with gravel raw materials for the self-made gravel provides the conditions.

China's construction projects followed, the state-owned industry for the need to guard against the construction of environmental pollution and natural sand and gravel resources savings, and the rapid development of basic construction needs to use a lot of aggregate, natural gravel has Can not meet the needs of the construction, also contributed to the sale of artificial sand and gravel market, sand machine equipment as the key to the production of aggregate, but also by the market and customers of all ages, but also to promote the rapid development of the construction industry, For the national infrastructure projects to carry out no further care, sand machine equipment has become the new darling of the market was sold.


Shanghai World State Heavy Machinery Co., Ltd. is a collection of mining machinery product development, manufacturing and sales as one of the large enterprises, the main products are broken gravel series, industrial milling series, mineral processing equipment series, lime / cement equipment series. Production of composite crusher crushing ratio is greater, the maximum crushing ratio can be achieved by the material size can be adjusted, not by the hammer, liner wear; no screen bar set, broken moisture content, high mud content Material is not easy to plug; composite crusher with flexible adjustment mechanism, into the non-broken material can be automatically discharged, will not cause damage to the equipment; bearing horizontal layout, long life, you can break the high temperature materials (such as cement clinker) Crusher rotor body structure is unique, broken material, the rotor body is almost no wear; rear cavity is equipped with a screw or hydraulic opening mechanism, do not have the main equipment, you can easily replace the wearing parts. Material from the upper part of the composite crusher vertical fall into the high-speed rotation of the impeller, under the action of high-speed centrifugal force, and another part of the umbrella-shaped shunt in the impeller around the material to produce high-speed impact and crushing, the material after the impact, In the impeller and the shell between the material to form a number of eddy current collision, friction and crushing, from the lower part of the direct discharge, the formation of closed loop many times, by the screening equipment to achieve the required finished product size. In view of this, the composite crusher in the high-speed road treatment of gravel aggregate process is essential and the most suitable facilities.


Composite crusher technology not only improve the construction of our high-speed road to provide mechanical support, the state industry that the construction of the country's complete road network needs of our joint efforts, so the manufacture of high-performance composite crusher is the history of the industry Mission and common goal for the domestic mineral processing equipment production technology to improve, so that machinery manufacturers to see a broader market prospects, and always ready for the modernization of the motherland dedication.
