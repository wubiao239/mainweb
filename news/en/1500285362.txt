World Economy: the development and utilization of new energy to promote the development of the mill industry



The same time as the above-

In the 21st century, under the dual constraints of limited resources and environmental protection, economic and social sustainable development was achieved and developing countries faced major challenges. Strengthen the renewable energy and new energy application technology cooperation in the development and promotion, promote regional renewable energy and new energy use, promote energy conservation. China's 'Eleventh Five-Year Plan' pointed out that to build a resource-saving and environment-friendly society, focusing on the development of circular economy, insist on both development and conservation priorities, in accordance with the reduction, re-use, resource-based principles, Production, consumption, waste generation, consumption and other sectors, and gradually establish the whole society of resources recycling system; to save energy, water conservation, saving land, saving materials, strengthen the comprehensive utilization of resources to promote conservation and other policies. In the current environment, the economic development of energy demand is more urgent than ever before, is expected by 2020, with China's new energy revitalization plan will be introduced and the relevant development goals of adjustment, China's total investment in the field of new energy will exceed 3 trillion yuan, and these demand caused by the climax of mining construction and grinding equipment market 'hot' is also particularly noticeable.


The development of new energy economy industry, it is important to cultivate new economic growth point, the future of renewable energy and new energy industry will have a huge and blank space for development, which also for the development of the mining machinery industry to provide new opportunities. And as a non-renewable resources of the mine resources, if you want to develop into a real 'ecological' resources, the future development will need to rely on environmentally friendly energy-saving mining machinery, which will help to stimulate the demand for mining machinery, Milling machines and other industry equipment to bring a new round of development climax, but also on the future of environmental protection and energy saving mine mechanical crusher mill equipment development put forward a very high demand.


In the context of the market economy, due to the market demand driven, in the harmonious development of mankind and nature, the future of mine machinery should be toward the digital, intelligent, ecological and pleasant direction. Therefore, the state of industrial advice, mining equipment counterparts should use the country to vigorously promote the development and utilization of new energy favorable opportunity to vigorously develop new environmentally friendly energy efficient crusher mill products and equipment, closely around the 'scientific environmental protection and efficient' theme , Two-pronged approach, hard work internal strength.


At present, the state of the industry's technical quality system running smoothly, effective. Since the founding of the beginning, the enterprise put the 'green energy' principle really put in place, according to the hardness of processing materials and materials expected fineness and the final output, milling machine can be divided mine milling machine, high pressure hanging roller mill , Strong ultra-fine milling machine, HGM ultra-fine milling machine and other types of milling machine. State-owned industry under the years of experience in the production of milling machine, equipment constantly updated, technology continues to improve, the latest development of a series of new milling machine with energy saving and environmental protection role, in particular, in line with national policies on energy conservation, especially in recent years Of the power plant flue gas desulfurization applications, plays a very critical role. Therefore, the state industry believes that China's mining machinery and equipment industry should be committed to product innovation and enterprise restructuring to jointly promote China's energy saving, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the development of low-carbon economy, to achieve economic and social sustainable development.
