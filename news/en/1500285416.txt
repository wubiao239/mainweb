Classification and characteristics of iron ore crushing equipment, the development of crusher




The same time as the above-
In the past 60 years, the use of iron ore has changed greatly. From the beginning of the founding of new China can not create all types of crusher, to now have a full set of production, supply all kinds of iron ore used in the size of the crusher. From the size of specifications, size, the total production of various crusher, have leapt to the forefront of the world. The maximum size crusher produced in our country is listed in Table 3 1-1.

China's key iron ore, since the reform and opening up, the introduction of a large number of foreign advanced crushing machinery. For example, Anshan Iron and Steel and other Shougang Iron Mine Iron Mine were introduced r Sweden Svdt. Dala and Germany Krupp the most advanced large-scale hydraulic rotary crusher, Fujian Zijin Group introduced r Sandvik S series of cyclone crusher, Baotou Iron and Steel Plant, Wuxiang Chengchao Iron Mine, Hui Dashan Iron Mine are the introduction of r Sandvik H series cone crusher and Metso Metso Hp hydraulic cone crusher. The original Beijing Heavy Machinery Factory introduced the German KHD company technology to produce the Mament series of large hammer crusher (6 kinds of specifications), Tianjin Cement Design Institute designed and developed the TpC series of large hammer crusher, Nanjing Cement Design Institute development rpDC series of large hammer Type crusher. L sea construction road and bridge company and Shanghai multi-ling Watson company has absorbed foreign advanced technology has also developed a new hammer crusher and large-scale impact crusher and occupy a large share of the domestic market. Beijing, the new powder Engineering Technology Co., Ltd. adhere to the combination of scientific research and development and production, take the road of independent innovation, introduced to the market 1200, 1500 double-chamber laminated crusher, its structure and principles have not yet seen in foreign countries to fill The small and medium-sized crushing machine blank, the market outlook is very promising, can replace the import of small and medium-sized cone crusher. Beijing Mining and Metallurgy Research Institute and Russia co-manufacturing ∮ 1200 a inertia cone drunk machine, has been successfully used in industrial production in China's crusher development, has made considerable progress, but there are still some urgent improvements.

The crusher is a device that uses a fixed mechanism to break large pieces of material into small pieces by one or more force applying methods. It is widely used in industrial production of a class of general equipment. According to its]. (Such as jaw crusher), rotary-type crusher (such as rotary crusher, cone crusher, double-cavity rotary crusher, etc.), roll pressure, crusher, crusher, Crusher (such as roller crusher, high pressure roller mill) and impact crusher (such as hammer crusher, impact crusher and cage crusher) and several other types.

'More broken less grinding' theory is to smash the energy of T-stage technology is an important indicator of progress. Reduce the size of broken products, improve the processing capacity of the ball mill, reduce the grinding operation energy consumption of the more broken and less grinding academic thinking.
