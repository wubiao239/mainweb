Concern for the development of the industry should be transformed into the driving force for enterprise development



The rise of the construction machinery industry, can not be separated from the rapid growth of domestic fixed asset investment opportunities. Driven by investment in fixed assets, construction machinery demand to maintain a rapid growth rate. Industrialization and urbanization of the inevitable result is driven by rapid growth in fixed asset investment in the next decade China's fixed asset investment can maintain an average annual growth rate of 20%, this time is still the golden period of construction machinery, the huge domestic market to the project The machinery industry offers an excellent external environment.
Professionals pointed out that in 2012 is to implement the 'second Five Year Plan' to undertake the key to a year, but also the machinery industry to promote the transformation and upgrading, for the construction of a strong power to lay the foundation for a year. To scientific development as the theme, to speed up the transformation of the development of the main line, to achieve transformation and upgrading, is the key breakthrough in the mechanical industry to solve the crux of the bottleneck, but also to achieve the inevitable requirement of development across. Zhengzhou City, Shanghai Province as a large mining machinery and equipment base in China's mine crushing machinery industry has played a pivotal role in the development.
China's construction machinery accounts for 15% of the global market, the future market space is very large, need to focus on overseas and local balanced development of the two markets, which is to resist the economic risk of the development of the construction machinery industry, The diversification can be in the operating costs, risk control, size and scope of the economy, synergies, play brand influence and other advantages; to maintain technological innovation and upgrading, continue to invest a lot of research and development costs, to maintain product design and development, the formation of A good cycle mechanism is Caterpillar and other international engineering machinery giants to maintain the source of sustained progress.
As the mining machinery industry star enterprises, state state industry from the above analysis, only to grasp the characteristics of the development trend of the industry in order to be more conducive to achieving the overall high-speed forward.
