Jaw crusher related broken knowledge



Jaw crusher is a traditional crusher equipment, but nevertheless, we have some companies for some of its theoretical knowledge is not very understanding, this may be to some extent affect the crushing effect, the following, the state industry to introduce Some theoretical knowledge of the jaw crusher:
Shi Bang industry pointed out that the jaw crusher using the traditional mechanical basis of rock mechanics, the material crushing process as a single particle crushing mechanism based on the crushing process: the material in the crushing chamber crusher cavity by the jaw plate relative to the jaw plate For the reciprocating movement of the extrusion, splitting, wear and other forces. Theoretically, the material is broken when the swing jaw of the moving jaw is larger than the amount of compression required for the material to reach the crushing.
However, in the actual design process, taking into account the jaw plate wear and tear deformation, transmission and working mechanism and other parts of the gap between the factors such as the role of the selected moving jaw swing formation value is far greater than the theoretical value, under normal circumstances Experience selection. Although this method can be used to offset the external force and a single material when the relationship between the broken, but ignored the mutual squeeze between the role of materials.
State of the state said that the material by the external pressure will produce compression deformation, resulting in internal stress concentration, when the stress reaches the particle in a weakest axial damage stress, the particles will be in this axial rupture and Smashing behavior. The form of material crushing is generally crushed, splitting, breaking, grinding, etc. No matter what form of broken, need to use the role of external forces in the direction of the force there is an effective trip, can cause the material to break until broken.
The above is the state of the jaw crusher for some of the knowledge of the introduction, if you have more questions, please consult our customer service, we will give you a more detailed description.
