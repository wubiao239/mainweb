Construction waste treatment equipment achievements sand and gravel new energy



The same time as the above-

Construction waste on our living environment has a wide range of erosion, for the construction of garbage if the implementation of long-term regardless of attitude, then for urban environmental health, living conditions, land quality assessment and so have a bad influence. People in modern society have realized the great value of construction waste, construction waste disposal and recycling began to pop up in the community set off a small recovery boom. In fact, the construction waste recycling and reuse of a variety of ways, the use of construction waste recycling recycled aggregate is one of the more widely used in a way, made of products can be widely used in construction and highway and other fields.


Construction waste crushing station is a professional construction waste crushing equipment, through the construction waste crushing station broken construction waste can be used to produce the corresponding strength grade of concrete, mortar or the preparation of such as blocks, wall panels, floor tiles and other building materials. Thick aggregate Aggregate materials can also be used for road pavement.


In the process of production of aggregate aggregate, the construction waste must be crushed, the cement industry as a gravel aggregate adjacent industries, the development of aggregate production has its unique advantages, such as industry relevance, capital Operating capacity, production scale, advanced management technology, strong mineral resources, coupled with the State Council ten measures to stimulate economic policy makes sandstone investors overwhelmed, some cement companies have to supply direction to the newly approved railway, highway, etc. Gravel aggregate. The main equipment for the production of gravel aggregate include: jaw crusher, impact crusher, cone crusher, impact gravel production line (sand making machine). With the technology continues to mature, high-speed rail, highway construction and other major construction projects, the aggregate requirements of the aggregate is followed.


In the cement gravel aggregate production process, in order to ensure that the concrete required to achieve a variety of gravel aggregate aggregate, especially the finished product sand powder content, the state industry for the cement industry's resource advantages, in particular, developed a mobile crushing Large-scale crater production line, high-speed high-iron aggregate production line, hydropower station artificial sand production line (sand production line), gravel production line, such as crushing and sieving, large-scale crusher production line, large-scale crushing stone production line, large-scale sand making machine, Equipment, its products are widely used in mining, cement, chemicals, roads, railways and other industries, especially in the highway, high-speed rail construction and other high-quality artificial aggregate production has accumulated a wealth of experience, the introduction of aggregate production equipment In many national projects for large-scale projects.
