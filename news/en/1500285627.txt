The impact of crusher advantage of the market can not block the mainstream products



The same time as the above-

From the current point of view, mining machinery has begun to digital, intelligent, energy saving and pleasant development. And in this process will naturally involve the conservation of land, saving materials, strengthen the use of resources, research and development of new technologies and other fields, only through continuous coordination and running, in order to ultimately achieve the enterprise product 'quality' leap, With the 'amount' of the breakthrough, counterattack crusher is to follow this concept and design and manufacturing.


Impact crusher equipment since its inception, has been among the best in the crusher equipment industry sales, which is its strong crushing ratio and broken material out of the particle size, material shape controllability is inseparable, and its hard wear broken parts And the internal structure of the counterattack crusher rotor high-speed rotation, the material into the rotor hammer after the impact of crushing, and then back to the liner again crushed, and finally discharged from the discharge port. And the user can also adjust the gap between the counter and the rotor frame can be achieved to change the material size and material shape of the purpose of the impact crusher can handle particle size side length of not more than 300mm, compressive strength of not more than 260Mpa of various materials, With a large crushing ratio, high crushing efficiency, the product shape was cube, can be selectively broken and so on.


The impact crusher is named according to the working principle, that is, the use of the principle of counter-crushing broken material, is a more than jaw crusher crusher equipment, in the stone production line is mainly used for crushing operations, and jaw Crusher to break together. Impact crusher equipment products are divided into mining, cement, concrete industry with three categories, the product is suitable for a variety of compressive strength of the ore practical. On the granite, limestone, river pebbles and other compressive strength of the material has a better applicability. When a device can be widely recognized in a certain way, this device has been technically or applied to become mainstream equipment. For a long time, most of the impact crusher with the jaw crusher to work together to become the main equipment for crushing operations.


There is a growing need for aggregate in infrastructure, which requires a higher demand for broken products to meet this requirement. The working principle of the three-chamber crushing of the counter-crusher has reduced the use of the screening equipment to break down the material grade, and the classification of the three cavity types makes the crushing ratio large enough to meet the needs of large output and low energy consumption , Investment in a variety of small requirements, coupled with the impact crusher equipment broken than large, broken grain shape is good, low energy consumption, investment and other factors undoubtedly created a counterattack crusher has become a crusher market mainstream products inevitable trend The
