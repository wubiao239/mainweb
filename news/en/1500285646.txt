Crusher industry to take the road to scientific and technological innovation demand for mineral resources



The same time as the above-

From the domestic and international mineral resources situation analysis and the world social and economic development trends look to the future, advocate and promote the continuous development of relevant science and technology and applied to mineral resources exploration, development, use, promote rational, conservation, recycling of mineral resources and protection of mining Environment, become a current trend and development direction. In recent years, China's mineral resources development and integration has made a breakthrough, in promoting the advantages of enterprises to focus on development, but also improve the development and utilization of mineral resources, the level of technology. As the necessary mining resources mining machinery, enhance technological innovation and technological content, is bound to promote the expansion of the scale of mineral resources integration, homeopathic lead crusher industry to the upsurge of innovation.


In order to meet the needs of mineral resources mining and processing, state state of industry to rely on its strong R \u0026 D strength in the market demand for rapid response, the current research and development of the domestic advanced level of the impact crusher, European version of jaw crusher, Europe Version of the impact crusher, tricyclic medium speed mill, a strong ultra-fine grinding machine and a series of crushing and grinding equipment to meet the mineral resources after the integration of market demand, conform to the national energy-saving emission reduction and eliminate backward production capacity The request. In the process of integration of mineral resources development, the company will adhere to independent innovation, and constantly optimize the structural performance of products to meet the future trend of large-scale mineral resources industry.


As a mining machinery and equipment industry, a star, the state-owned industry has always insisted on the concept of science to guide our customers to reduce costs, lean production, improve efficiency. In the future development of the road, the state industry will, as always, concentrated on product development, and strive to help China's building materials machinery and cement machinery manufacturing capacity step by step close to the world level. Mineral resources continue to demand a large extent to promote the rapid development of the crusher industry, crusher industry is the promoter of progress.
