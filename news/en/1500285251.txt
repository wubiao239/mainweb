What are the precautions for the daily maintenance of the crusher?



Crusher because of its production capacity, stable and reliable, is one of the stone production line. At the same time because the crushing machine production process is simplified, the structure is simple, so easy maintenance. But there are some details of the place in the daily inspection and maintenance to be taken seriously, so as to ensure the smooth progress of production. Here, the state state industry to introduce the maintenance of the crusher Note:
First, the equipment before the start of the inspection work, mainly to check all parts and bolts to ensure a good state of fastening.
Second, the head is an important part of the crusher, due to its long hammering effect, is one of the most weary parts, in the daily maintenance should always check, or replace.
Third, check the lubrication of the lubrication of the equipment state to determine the lubrication point in the ideal state. In the mechanical lubrication point of the daily maintenance will use professional cleaning grease, select the oil when the reference equipment in which the operating environment, such as temperature, humidity and other factors. Red Star machine recommend you use calcium - sodium - based lubricants, under normal circumstances, the machine operation more than 900 hours or 6 months to change the oil.
Fourth, the installation of the bearing outer ring covered with the rotor shaft cone the same thing to prevent possible corrosion.
5. To compensate for the wear between the broken plate and the hammer, to adjust the distance between the broken plate and the hammer before use, mainly through the broken plate support device before and after the movement to achieve.
Above is the state of the industry for the daily operation of the crushing machine some of the introduction, I hope these help our business. If you have more questions, please contact our customer service, we will give you a more detailed description.
