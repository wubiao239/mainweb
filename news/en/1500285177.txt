Impact crusher in the new breakthrough in mineral processing to achieve a multi-purpose machine



In history, the jaw crusher and the oldest of the counter crusher. Impact crusher is characterized by small size, simple structure, broken than large (up to 40), less energy consumption, production capacity, product size uniformity, and selective role in the mine, is a very promising equipment The
The state of the new type of counterattack crusher to change the traditional counter-break a single broken mode, the use of three-cavity and two-cavity broken like a combination of ways to greatly improve the application of counterattack crusher, making the counter-crusher can be convenient To achieve the material of the rough and fine broken processing, in the introduction of the market since the majority of gravel material production and processing customers wide acclaim, in the construction waste treatment, dry mortar production industry, widely used, the market prospect is broad.
Shanghai Shibang Industrial R \u0026 D and production of a series of crusher equipment research and development based mainly on the crusher equipment performance is easy to operate and reliable quality, similar crusher equipment, low energy consumption, low operating management costs. In addition, the equipment load factor, the processing of product size, gradation change is also an important assessment criteria for crusher. A variety of crusher composed of gravel production line can be based on customer specifications for the use of stone and the production of free to determine, to provide customers with the best configuration.
The survey found that the current crusher products are crushing, coarse grinding function, and the impact of crusher structure is simple and reasonable, good grain size, low operating costs, in a wide range can replace the small jaw crusher and Cone crusher, and even sand making machines and other equipment, a real machine more use. In addition, according to the site, materials and investment, and always unremittingly engaged in the research and development of broken machinery, the state of the industry's goal is as soon as possible to a variety of innovative technology can be converted to customers can bring high efficiency machinery and equipment. Shanghai Shibang Industry can provide VSI, PCL sand making machine, new type anti-crusher, new jaw crusher and new type cone crusher according to customers' production demand, and provide the most suitable and perfect equipment for customers.
