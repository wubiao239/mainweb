Crushing Machinery High Efficiency Sand Making Machine Green Sand Making Model



The same time as the above-

At present, due to the rapid economic development, resource shortages more and more people's attention. There are many non-renewable resources, in the face of this situation only to improve the utilization of resources to slow down the depletion of resources. How to improve the utilization of resources has become a major industry research topics.


Shanghai Shi Bang Industrial is a professional engaged in mining machinery and equipment research and development, production enterprises. The main products include series: impact crusher, jaw crusher, ring hammer crusher, cone crusher, etc .; drying equipment series: three backhaul dryer, slime dryer, double cylinder dryer ; Including sand production line equipment, mineral processing production line equipment and other large mining machinery and equipment. The state has been actively responding to the call of the country, follow the road of economic development, conform to the development trend of the times, and win the competition to meet the different requirements of customers. Production of efficient sand making machine in the artificial production of artificial gravel has an important position.


Efficient crusher, also known as the third generation of sand making machine, is efficient and practical crushing machinery, it appears to a great extent to ease the human activities caused by excessive resources, energy shortages, serious environmental pollution and other issues, because the construction of gravel Of the huge amount of human survival is facing a natural sand resources and the environment of the severe test, and efficient crusher with the international leading level, a variety of hard and brittle materials crushed and broken, to achieve a very good effect in energy saving and traditional Crusher can be achieved compared to 50%, truly efficient, energy efficient, green and sustainable development to achieve indispensable crusher equipment.


High-performance crusher produced by the artificial sand can be widely used in masonry, plaster, repair, grouting and paste the finishes and other projects, is the construction of large quantities of one of the building materials. The development of green building sand proposed the use of advanced high efficiency and low consumption of playing sand machinery and equipment on slag and other solid waste deep processing, it is possible to replace Portland cement and lime to prepare most of the building sand, the cement and cement mixed sand unified Mortar. High-efficiency crusher can be a variety of hard rock (rocks, granite, basalt, limestone, river pebbles, etc.) metal non-metallic ore broken into a variety of particle size of the building with sand and gravel, sandy particle size uniformity, production capacity , Hammer long life, supporting power is small, variable three broken for the two crushing, crusher simplification process, simple structure, easy maintenance, smooth operation, high compressive strength, than the natural sand, hammer crusher production of sand Meet the high standards of construction sand requirements, but also improve the quality of construction.


And to further strengthen the optimization of high-efficiency crusher, research, to maximize the efficiency of high-efficiency crusher to improve production efficiency and product quality, is an important factor in maintaining long-term active market, but also make efficient crusher in the field of crushing machinery to play its The largest market value, in the non-metallic solid construction waste disposal, but also an absolute advantage.
