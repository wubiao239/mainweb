Shibang Heavy Industry Crushing Equipment to Coordinate Economic Construction and Environmental Protection and Energy Conservation



The same time as the above-

Recently, the National Development and Reform Commission released the first quarter of 2012, the completion of energy-saving targets in 2012 quarterly barometer, central and eastern energy conservation progress is basically smooth, but Xinjiang, Gansu, Guizhou and other western regions of the energy-saving situation is very grim, which was classified as a warning District, in order to achieve comprehensive development of East, China and the West, to increase energy conservation reform of the western industry has become a national focus.


Singing the economic construction at the same time green has become the main theme of social development, in the global environment and energy crisis growing situation, the industry are deeply aware of: repeat the past that high consumption, high pollution, low efficiency of the extensive development Way, has not conform to the current situation, while the relevant policies introduced by the state has also increased the high energy consumption and high pollution industry regulation and control efforts, energy conservation and environmental protection will change the economic development mode to occupy more and more important position.


From the industrial point of view, the eastern part of the industry is mainly based on the new electronics industry and light industry, so the energy-saving transformation is more smooth, while the western provinces are mainly heavy mining industry, so energy-saving reform is more difficult.


In order to break this traditional, ineffective mining equipment to continue to waste the phenomenon of resources, some of China's innovative equipment manufacturers began to conduct a comprehensive analysis of foreign equipment, learn from each other, and finally launched the market's most scientific and most energy-efficient New equipment, such as Shanghai Shi Bang industry in the mining machinery market has launched a limestone hammer crusher, energy efficient coal gangue crusher, the larger production of basalts single-stage counterattack, etc., the emergence of these devices are China's mineral resources To achieve large-scale, environmental protection operations provide a fundamental support.


For a long time, the mining industry gives the impression that both: dirty, chaotic, poor, dust flying. Green and it seems to be no relationship with the crusher, but careful analysis of the concept of energy saving and environmental protection, you will find through the operation of the process of environmental protection, reduce pollution, the industry in energy conservation is also promising. The state-owned industry has been moving towards energy efficient and green, so that the image of high efficiency, high energy consumption and heavy pollution has changed greatly. It is more conducive to urban construction, and the broken construction waste can Use will also be the market's favor.
