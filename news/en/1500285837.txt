From the international look to find out the lack of the right medicine



China's mine equipment after a few years after the rapid development of the accumulation of many problems, such as the technical level and developed countries are still lagging behind the status of internal management, industrial structure and so much urgent need to adjust. And the financial crisis will further promote China's mining machinery industry to speed up the reorganization and integration, build a new pattern of industry and new order, so as to further enhance the mine machinery industry's overall anti-risk ability and competitive strength.
CBBC industry that in the final analysis, China and the international developed countries, the main reason for the existence of differences or technical level. Which is different from the market demand is the objective cause of the gap, due to the international market, outstanding mining machinery manufacturers concentrated in Europe and the United States, where large-scale capital construction stage has passed, the market demand for gravel material is small, and environmental requirements are high , Is bound to form a high concentration of gravel field to large-scale production to achieve environmental protection, they need mining machinery specifications, high automation program, strong mobility. To meet such a market demand for the development of mining machinery and domestic products are not the same, because we are in a large-scale capital construction period, the demand for mineral resources around the surge, causing investment in mineral resources, hot flowers everywhere often small scale, Only the market is fast, less investment, the market in short supply, shoddy, low level of technology, high energy consumption, serious environmental pollution products have entered, and these devices are often only able to occupy the market at low prices, so the gap with the international advanced level obvious.
From the current point of view, the domestic mining industry's technology base is not thick, and the field of mining machinery has been the market for technology as a way to improve product technology is not phase contrast, and to face foreign competitors, especially foreign competitors In the domestic investment and set up factories in the grim situation. Therefore, the domestic mining machinery business innovation consciousness was forced to be excited.
Said that enterprises in the face of innovation at home and abroad, the pressure of competitors, enterprises in recent years by the rapid adjustment, and now started to crusher, milling machine and sand making machine as the main product, manufacturing process and process technology application technology research work. Shanghai Shi Bang industry through pioneering and innovative ways to practice research and development of new products, mineral resources can meet the mining machinery proposed more specific and more innovative content, PFW European version of deep cavity hydraulic impact crusher, JC European version of jaw crushing Machine, HPC hydraulic cone crusher, VSI new sand making machine, European version of crusher series, SCM ultra-fine milling machine and other equipment are energy-saving, water-saving, comprehensive utilization, environment-friendly mining machinery products, and can To the equipment operators to create a safe and comfortable working environment.
