Anti - crusher to promote the recycling of waste resources



In response to the call of the state to promote sustainable development, mining machinery manufacturers Shanghai World State Heavy Machinery Co., Ltd. (referred to as the state state of industry) for different levels of different waste resources to provide different varieties of broken crusher, common jaw crusher, Impact crusher, cone crusher, sand making machine and hydraulic cone crusher.
Shi Bang industrial production of professional granite, also known as PF counterattack crusher, is a use of impact energy to break the material. When the material into the plate hammer area, by the semi-vertical high-speed impact of the crushed material was constantly thrown into the rotor above the counterattack device, and then hit the liner back to the plate hammer area to be counterattack, the material by the big To the small disaster crushing cavity repeated broken. Until the material is broken to the required size, discharged from the lower part of the machine. Granite crusher with simple structure, no key connection, unique counter-liner; hard rock broken energy efficient, the product was cube, nesting particle size adjustable, simplified crushing process, saving production costs while high standards of high quality gravel Aggregate, in the high-quality waterway and water conservancy project is particularly obvious advantages, has become the current highways, railways, hydropower stations and other large areas of construction granite, limestone and other medium hardness material fragmentation essential.
Shanghai Shi Bang Industrial Station in the protection of the environment, take the road of sustainable development point of view, design and manufacture of counterattack crusher to adapt to the market, conform to the people, for the majority of crusher users and manufacturers to bring a chance. Intelligent high-end, low-carbon environmental protection has always been the state to adhere to the idea. In the current technology-led case, high-end low-carbon is undoubtedly a highly competitive market in a key indicator.
