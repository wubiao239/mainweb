Hammer crusher in the use of attention to the problem



Hammer crusher in the cement plant is mainly used for crushing or crushing medium hardness of the material. Over the years, in the hammer crusher routine maintenance and repair in the exploration of some experience, will now encounter problems and solutions to make a summary. The hammer of the hammer crusher is the main consumable. In the replacement, the vibration found when driving, will cause damage to the spindle bearing or coupling phenomenon, the use of short hammer.
Analysis of the main reason is because the hammer crusher in the process of breaking the ore material needs high-speed rotation of the impact force, so the hammer and related parts of the wear and tear damage in the hammer crusher maintenance work, the hammer The maintenance check and replacement cycle is shorter. In addition to the hammer outside the rotor on the other parts should also be carefully maintained to ensure the normal operation and quality of work.
CBBC industry to remind the majority of users, lubrication for bearing maintenance is very important. Lubrication can reduce the frictional resistance between the operation of the parts of the equipment and the wear and tear of the less effective parts. Therefore, strengthening the lubrication of the equipment is a very important and effective way to maintain and maintain the equipment. For some of the requirements: often pay attention to the fastening and fastening of the fastening; regularly check the sieve bar tone situation, if blocked should be immediately removed; feeding to be uniform, to prevent over-negative phenomenon; equipment in every eight hours After the lubrication of the bearing to maintain the work; bearing lubricants should be replaced every three months to ensure that the lubrication of the parts; in the oil, you should first use kerosene to thoroughly clean the bearings.
