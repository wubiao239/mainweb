Hammer crusher hammer size and the relationship between the hammer material



What is the relationship between the hammerhead size of the hammer crusher and the hammer material? Shi Bang industry pointed out that the hammer crusher hammer size is generally divided into two types: generally 3-20 kg hammer is called a small hammer, more than 20 kg is known as the big hammer, if the material points There are three kinds of high chrome crusher hammer, high manganese steel hammer, bimetallic hammer three kinds of small crusher hammer are generally used high chromium cast iron materials processing production, and hammer head is high Manganese steel material. In the crusher equipment construction, the hammer crusher hammer is generally one of the wearing parts of the crusher, the replacement frequency is very large, the hammer wear situation and many factors, such as material properties, hammer The first line speed, the size of the grate plate grate, etc., below, the state state industry to analyze the hammer crusher hammer size and hammer material selection relationship:
First, the direct relationship. Crusher hammer weight and wear resistance is a direct relationship, according to the principle of mechanics in the hammer work, when the material and high-speed rotation of the hammer impact, the material sharp into the hammer surface, the formation of impact pits, the impact Force all to the hammer surface of the compressive stress, and high manganese steel because of its toughness is better, by a certain weight of the object after the attack, will form a certain hardness on the hammer surface, hammer only reach a certain weight, To deal with the great impact of heavy objects, which converted into compressive stress, to extend the life of the effect
Second, the hardness relationship. As the hardness of high-chromium material is relatively high, if the broken material weight exceeds a certain limit, it will be brittle by the hard, resulting in the hammer in the course of the operation caused by fracture, and the general crusher are in high-speed rotation of the state, Break the situation, ranging from the crusher in the wear parts are all broken, while the injured is disabled. So in the choice of we have to refer to the following criteria:
1, the feed size of 400 mm above the large crusher should be a single weight 50-125 kg or more hammer head, because the impact of large, should use the premise of safety, the main choice of high toughness of ultra-high manganese alloy steel, Can also use alloyed high manganese steel.
2, the feed size of less than 200mm small and medium-sized crusher more than a single weight 50kg hammer, because the impact is relatively small, ordinary high manganese steel work hardening capacity can not fully play, and therefore not wear, should choose carbon The upper limit of the alloy is high manganese steel or medium and low carbon alloy steel.
3, the feed size of 50mm below the small crusher more than a single weight 15kg hammer, by the impact of smaller, not suitable for high manganese steel, can choose medium carbon alloy steel, more suitable for the choice of composite hammer. The top of the hammer is made of high chromium cast iron, hammer handle with 35 # steel or low alloy steel, two materials, respectively, to play their own characteristics.
4, and the input particle size below 100mm crusher hammer, because the impact is moderate, should use high toughness ultra-high chromium cast iron, because of its hardness HRC60, impact toughness ak8J / cm ?, the service life can be higher than the high manganese steel 3 ~ 5 times.
Above is the state of the industry for the hammer crusher hammer size and hammer material selection between the relationship between the introduction, the state of industry pointed out that the scientific weight according to the weight of the hammer to choose the hammer casting material can directly affect the Hammer crusher life, it is recommended that enterprises a reasonable choice.
