World Weapons Heavy Industries to eliminate the details of the pursuit of perfection



With the gradual maturity and standardization of China's mining machinery market, the competitive mode of enterprise development has also changed from the original price, product quality, technology competition, and gradually entered the era of after-sales service competition, Shanghai World State Heavy Machinery Co., Ltd. Attaches great importance to customer service work, in contact with the early, the company will be based on the actual needs of users, to understand the processing of ore hardness, ore fineness, the final requirements of finished fineness and production, according to user investment, to the user to specify the entire production line process To ensure that users with the lowest investment in exchange for the highest economic benefits; equipment installation and commissioning period, the site for the user training and technical personnel to assist users to develop construction programs, on-site training operators, in the latter part of the equipment operation process, the company will send full- Personnel to assist customers to produce until the customer can run independently.
As the saying goes, 'the details of the decision to success or failure', a small screw can also make the machine failure, any small links are likely to cause big mistakes, and in this machinery industry should pay attention to, large machinery and equipment are equipped with various parts Into a ring of a ring, any damage to the parts will affect the operation of the entire machine. As a manufacturer of machinery and equipment, in the production of equipment, but also on the quality of parts strictly, the company's crusher, milling machine, sand making machine, mineral processing equipment and other products in the development of the mining market today, more Widely, in the milling equipment, Raymond Mill is now the most widely used milling equipment, its three-dimensional structure, small footprint, complete sets of advantages such that it is applied to the mining, industrial areas. As the mill is dealing with the ore, so the actual production and use, the relevant parts easier to wear, if the quality is not up to standard, you need to frequently replace the wearing parts, causing downtime, affecting the user's economic benefits.
CBBC Industry has been the customer's demand as the starting point, customer satisfaction is our achievement degree. To create value for customers, for the staff to seek benefits, in good faith cast foundation, is the state has always been the same mission. Domestic mining machinery industry after years of development, all aspects are perfect, production technology is also constantly updated, especially this year, crusher and milling machine industry is developing rapidly, the state industry has been outstanding in detail for the customer well known, over the years in the user group , Has a good reputation, and improve after-sales service system has also been the user's praise.
