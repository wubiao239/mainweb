Crusher equipment in the concrete and dry mortar market prospects



The same time as the above-

At present, rural housing construction, rural road construction reached a new peak, coupled with the rapid expansion of many second and third tier cities, roads and housing is the most obvious, and in the past by artificial means of concrete construction has obviously not suitable for the current market. Mine machinery and equipment Star crusher equipment in the construction of civil engineering is particularly important in the concrete and dry mortar market plays an important role.


Concrete is made of cementitious material, granular aggregate, water and, if necessary, the addition of admixtures and admixtures according to a certain proportion of uniform mixing, dense molding, curing the construction of concrete hardening made of an artificial stone. Concrete with rich raw materials, low prices, the production process is simple, so that the use of more and more. At the same time, concrete also has high compressive strength, good durability, wide range of strength and other characteristics. These features make it a very wide range of use, not only in a variety of civil engineering, is the shipbuilding industry, machinery industry, marine development, geothermal engineering, concrete is also an important material. Dry mortar equipment market prospects are very broad, there are production equipment, logistics equipment, pumping equipment, such as dry powder raw materials milling machine, dry mortar, mortar conveyor and so on. Now around the ground has not allowed to stir mortar, this time to promote dry mix mortar is very promising.


Infrastructure investment will gradually pick up, since 2012, the infrastructure project approval speed, engineering design increased, real estate sales to maintain a high growth rate, focusing on performance machinery and railway equipment, but also because of various infrastructure projects to develop , Sand making machine, crusher, pavement mill and other equipment sales will be very good.
