World state heavy industry milling machine: adhere to independent innovation to establish brand image



With the deepening of economic globalization, all countries in the world are vigorously developing their own economies to improve their national comprehensive national strength. China's mining machinery engineering has been a great development, before the reform and opening up, we rely mainly on self-reliance, independent development of domestic equipment; reform and opening up, we 'introduce, digest, absorb' and independent development of the development of domestic mining equipment, No small results. In the 21st century, one of the basic characteristics of the era of knowledge economy in the era of knowledge economy is the arrival of the information technology era.
Mill in the manufacturing industry as a relatively high technological content of the industry, the energy and raw material prices to withstand the strong, despite the impact of the financial crisis, the profit growth rate as in the past, but still maintained a good level of economic efficiency , With the crusher and other equipment, the growth rate and profitability of the mill will continue to lay an important foundation for the development.
State World Industrial as one of China's large-scale milling machine production enterprises, whether from ultra-fine milling machine to large-scale milling machine, or the traditional Raymond mill to the vertical milling machine and then to the vertical fine powder , Every time the upgrading of products, state state industry are walking in the forefront of the domestic industry, effectively promoted the upgrading of China's mill technology to ensure that the state-owned industry in the market leader, led the enterprise fast, healthy and effective Sustainable development. Since its inception, the company always adhere to independent innovation and research and development, is committed to product quality, service and brand competitiveness to enhance the focus on crusher equipment intelligent, pleasant and environmentally friendly energy-saving R \u0026 D and production, casting high-end brand image, leading mining machinery industry The development of brand strategy.
