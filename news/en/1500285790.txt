Broken equipment has become a tool for the reform of the coal industry



Coal resources is a non-renewable resources, change the backward mode of production, eliminate backward production capacity is an important way to effectively use coal, in the current rapid development of science and technology, the use of the market launch of modern mining equipment is China's coal industry to improve production levels key.
The National Energy Board issued a notice on the elimination of backward production capacity in the coal industry in 2012. The notice pointed out that 2012 will continue to eliminate coal production capacity, reduce the number of small coal, expand and ensure that large coal enterprises in the development of the industry The most important of which is the elimination of the same time while ensuring coal production, therefore, the use of modern coal mining equipment without delay.
China's coal enterprises compared with foreign countries, the biggest weakness is the small workshop-style production, and this mode of production is caused by the effect of old and backward mining equipment, a serious waste of resources, etc., to the overall development of China's coal industry has brought great The resistance. Market demand and industry prospects require coal enterprises to change the mode of development, eliminate backward production capacity, increase new capacity, and new production capacity can not be separated from the support of new equipment, therefore, large-scale, modern coal mining equipment to become enterprise reform Direction theme.
We know that the most critical part of coal mining is the crushing of coal, the degree of its broken directly determines the utilization of coal, therefore, choose large-scale, scientific and technological coal crusher will be the key to increase production of coal enterprises. With the continuous progress of science and technology, some enterprises in China began to work hard on the coal crusher, developed a series of new equipment, such as domestic professional mining machinery manufacturers Shanghai Shi Bang industry launched coal shredders, impact crusher, The original coal hammer crusher, clean coal crusher and other equipment are in the original crusher on the basis of the introduction of advanced technology, the success of creating a modern coal, automated operation greatly saves the coal enterprises in human, material and other aspects of investment , Especially for the current large-scale production requirements of coal enterprises.
