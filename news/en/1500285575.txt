Mining machinery remanufacturing industry, the rise of green mines




The re-manufacturing industry was developed in the developed countries in the 1990s to develop a new industry.It is based on the product life cycle theory, in order to achieve the performance of waste products to enhance the purpose of leaping, with energy saving, materials, environmental protection, quality and other Compared with the traditional manufacturing industry, manufacturing similar products, remanufacturing industry usually consumes less than 1/10 of energy, less than 1/5 of the material and only produce less than 1/4 of the pollution. China's resource constraints and the environment The problem is becoming increasingly serious, the development of remanufacturing industry will help in the premise of energy saving and environmental protection to achieve the upgrading of industrial structure, better ease the pressure of employment and play a comparative advantage.


General mine machinery and equipment normal life of 20 to 30 years, a large number of non-extended service of complete sets of equipment will also enter the scrap phase.


According to the design and manufacture of traditional mining machinery concept, these mining equipment after the scrapped, it becomes a pile of scrap iron and garbage, scrap metal parts recycling mainly using the furnace smelting method, the product is a 'cradle to the grave' Process, not only recycling and remanufacturing use rate is very low, and waste mining machinery products seriously polluted, if the waste mine mechanical and electrical products can not be timely and effective resource regeneration, will become the community, especially mine pollution.

Hazards are mainly manifested in three aspects:


① pollution of the environment, due to the composition of waste mining machinery parts and components, individual parts and even contain lead, arsenic, mercury and other harmful substances, if improper handling or treatment is not timely, not only cause air, soil and water quality serious pollution, Healthy body;


② take up a lot of space, mining machinery for the power of large, since the major, take up space, 'silly, big, stupid, thick' equipment; after disposal if not timely and free stacking, not only destroyed the beauty of the environment, A lot of land or space; (big gold hammer)


③ constitute a security risk, because of our lack of second-hand product quality testing standards and effective control measures, so that some should be scrapped mining machinery flow to individual township coal mines and small mines, which have eliminated scrap coal equipment, not only caused excessive energy waste, Noise interference, environmental pollution, etc., and easily lead to a direct threat to personal safety accidents.


Therefore, the establishment of mining machinery recycling mechanism, the mining machinery parts of the market circulation to implement strict supervision and strengthen the recycling of remanufacturing technology research, is imminent.


In China, the theory of remanufacturing technology is not long, and there are still few enterprises engaged in commercial remanufacturing. In 1999, Xu Binshi put forward the concept of 'remanufacturing' in China for the first time in 2000. In 2000, 'green remanufacturing project and its Application prospect 'from the perspective of engineering analysis of the remanufacturing project status, role, discipline composition and key technologies, prospects of remanufacturing engineering in China's application prospects.


It can be seen that the remanufacturing of parts and components in waste mining machinery is equivalent to or higher than the remanufacturing of original products by absorbing various new technologies, new processes, re-manufacturing or upgrading, including advanced surface engineering technology Products, bright prospects. Mine enterprises in the extended service equipment of the public, large-scale equipment, out of scrapped equipment
