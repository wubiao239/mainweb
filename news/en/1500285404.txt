The steep cone cone crusher is similar to the tapered crusher of the existing coarse crushing cycle. Its movement trajectory and the advantages of the same with the rotary crusher, it is not repeat. Its shortcomings are more sensitive to the feeding of the material in the feed, such as more than 5% of the feed in the fine-grained material, in the feed money, these materials should be screened, otherwise it will reduce efficiency, increase wear, When this type of cone crusher with hydraulic technology into the bottom of the hydraulic support or top hydraulic hanging cone crusher, due to the different location of the hydraulic device caused by the advantages and disadvantages similar to the same cycle crusher, nor repeat.

This type of crusher also includes spherical cone crusher, retaining the spring overload protection device, although the current also used hydraulic and air pressure regulation of the discharge port device, hydraulic overload protection device, but each was a separate system, in particular the use of hydraulic and air pressure regulation After the discharge port, the need to increase the hydraulic locking device, which is complicated, the operation is not as convenient as the hydraulic steep cone cone crusher, however, because of its high yield, is still widely used.

The specifications of the conical crusher are different from the rotary crusher. At present the country is the size of the cone to the size of the cone, such as 3050 mm cone crusher, is that its movable cone maximum diameter of 3050 mm.

The following are the main structure of the cone crusher:

1. Rack: Cone crusher frame is generally composed of the upper frame and the lower frame, double-arm suspension or three-arm suspension of the upper frame to form a whole, only the individual manufacturers are the arms of the suspension and On the rack separated, with each other to the cone with the bolt connection, once again with the ore friction are located with high chrome panels.

2. Feeding device: Many manufacturers of cone crusher have sub-tray (some called the material plate) and the addition of funnel, sub-tray is generally installed in the spindle, with the spindle rotation, for the handling of special materials Species, sub-tray driven by a separate motor.

3. Crushing chamber: 50 years of cone crusher and crushing chamber can be divided into coarse, fine, two or rough, medium and fine three, that is, standard, short head cone crusher, is currently suitable for handling a variety of different materials Need the same specifications of the cone crusher, has reached six different forms of crushing chamber. At present, there is a new type of crushing chamber for obtaining fine materials.

4. Spindle: There are two types of single-ended support and double-ended support, the former in the slow cone cone crusher used on the latter in the steep cone cone crusher used.

The compression of the double-ended support is supported by both ends of the spindle, so the stress of the spindle is much less than that of the single support.

5. Drainage port adjustment device, cone crusher wear a large, so require a better row of mouth adjustment device, the current steep cone cone crusher hydraulic type, easy to adjust quickly, one person can be within a minute Complete, and under the load can also be adjusted, advanced several can be equipped with automatic adjustment system, not only shows the size of the discharge port, but also to protect the minimum cycle load to obtain maximum production capacity. The slow cone cone crusher is still mechanically or with the adjustment of the distance between the two ways, which is relatively backward, in this equipment, even if the additional hydraulic or pneumatic adjustment of the discharge port device, and steep cone hydraulic cone crusher Easy to adjust.

6. Overload protection: The taper cone cone crusher uses a spring overload protection device, which is obviously a backward way, so this type of crusher is now attached with a separate hydraulic system for overload protection.

7. Lubrication system: Cone crusher lubrication system and rotary crusher is basically the same. Eccentric bushings and gears are generally co-forced for commissioning systems. But there are individual manufacturers of eccentric sleeve and gear each with a separate lubrication system.

8. Transmission: advanced several, has been used spiral bevel gear, individual large-scale models by the motor directly through the coupling bevel gear, without the need for V-belt drive, saving adjustment belt time.
