Mine machinery and equipment contribute to the construction of Xinjiang



The same time as the above-

Infrastructure construction is inseparable from the gravel concrete, sandstone concrete huge need to strongly stimulate the Xinjiang region broken, sand equipment market, many domestic crushing equipment manufacturers have to Xinjiang region, open up their markets, to seize the opportunity to combine Xinjiang characteristics of mineral characteristics , Xinjiang region tailored large-scale aggregate production line.


Shanghai Shibang Heavy Machinery Co., Ltd. was established in 1997 to engage in crusher, sand making machine, gravel production line industry for many years, the development of mining machinery industry has been among the best, the company advanced technology as the core, humane management as the basis, to create first-class Enterprise team. The main products of the company are crusher, sand making machine, gravel production line, construction waste equipment, impact crusher, etc., in the construction waste industry in the development of mobile construction waste equipment, brick construction waste equipment, fixed construction waste And other classified products for the main products in the development of mining machinery in the construction of garbage equipment have sufficient strength


Shanghai Shibang Industry for the Xinjiang area of ​​mineral characteristics tailored 40t / h large-scale concrete aggregate production line in Karamay Xinjiang days Shield Special Cement Co., Ltd. after the stone plant put into operation, with excellent quality and excellent performance, its production Aggregate not only can guarantee the production of high-performance concrete, but also for Karamay and the surrounding areas of the construction industry to provide high-quality raw materials, has been successfully applied to a number of key projects in Xinjiang.


Shi Bang Industrial's construction waste treatment equipment for artificial aggregate processing system, with excellent performance, high reliability, short length, small footprint, light weight, strong mobility, reduce material transport costs, adaptability Strong, flexible combination, easy to transport, assembly time is short, operation and maintenance of safe, simple, in line with strict environmental standards and other characteristics and advantages. Its good performance and mobility as if it is tailored for the highway works. The fineness modulus, stone powder content, gravel grading, needle-like content, ultra-astronomical and other parameters can meet the requirements of Shi Zhong Expressway bridge, tunnel, pavement and other projects. Material requirements, to produce in line with the specifications of the finished aggregate, it can be seen, artificial aggregate aggregate in the highway project is completely feasible and promising.
