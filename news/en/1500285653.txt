Crusher industry ushered in the development opportunities manufacturers should upgrade themselves



The same time as the above-

National policy aspects of the development of basic equipment more and more attention to the demand for raw materials in the sand will be greatly increased, which to a large extent contributed to the development of China's crusher industry last year, China's rapid economic development, the majority of the central and western Regional economic growth rate of more than 10%, can predict the prospects of the crusher industry is still a bright, according to the relevant departments expected this year, the central project construction investment of up to two trillion yuan. Which undoubtedly gave the construction machinery company has brought a golden development period.


According to the latest Twelfth Five-Year Plan, China's urban construction, central and western areas of road traffic construction still has a lot of room for development, with the regional revitalization, highways, railway lines, affordable housing construction and water conservancy investment construction, These projects and projects will inevitably lead to a large number of gravel demand, which has brought new opportunities for the crusher industry, which may be the development of the local road to improve the rural road traffic and maintain the rapid development of local economy. Crusher industry development of another spring. Many are not professional engineering machinery companies have also took the opportunity to enter the crusher market, resulting in mixed varieties of crusher, performance ranging from quality, quality is vastly different, a direct impact on the crusher industry in the domestic and international development stage.


The current formation of the vicious competition, the inevitable crusher industry will have a negative impact on the healthy development. Shanghai Shi Bang industry on the crusher common problems were analyzed, the organization of professional technical team to study the causes of the problem and its improvement methods, made a breakthrough. Not only makes the crusher performance, work efficiency, and independent innovation developed a new type of crusher equipment, opened up a new market in the international market, and get praise. As a professional company in the field of crusher: the state has been seeking innovation, quality and development, to win customers, stability and enhance the quality and status of mountain Friends of machinery, with a view to the crusher in the field of innovation and glory.
