China's crusher industry focus on innovation to establish a brand to enter the world



The same time as the above-

China's rich mineral resources, in recent decades with the cause of China's development, mining machinery industry has been greatly developed. Crusher industry is China's infrastructure construction and mining equipment to support the important industries, so the crusher market has a large consumer groups, coupled with a strong human advantages and technological advantages, China's crusher equipment to catch up even more than foreign products Quality without mentioning.


However, the analysis of China's crusher market can be seen, due to the equipment technology is a big flaw, most crusher companies still rely on lower product prices to get the market, the consequences of this situation is low value-added products, low profits, Sufficient funds to continue to develop. There is a low-cost competition in the industry, imitation plagiarism has been unable to adapt to high-speed forward market operation, so improve the industry's innovative ability to increase the product technology content injection, with independent patents, design and focus on brand building is business A small market to get a place and lasting survival of the king.


Shanghai Shi Bang industry that China's crusher industry has two powerful factors in the development. On the one hand, with the continuous improvement of national economic strength in recent years, has continuously narrowed the gap with the developed countries, technical level and energy level. But at the same time also faced with fierce market competition, plus foreign use of leading edge technology and market share brought about by the pressure, greatly stimulated the crushing machine industry transformation and upgrading of the urgent task, such as to speed up the crusher industry within the structure of the perfect, occupation International science and technology innovation heights, grasp the strategic emerging industry, the right to speak, and consciously use high-tech to enhance product performance, innovation and research and development to achieve new breakthroughs. On the other hand, the state through direct or indirect policy to guide the crusher industry development model changes. Promote the real economy, promote the equipment manufacturing industry, a good atmosphere of independent innovation, and further build support equipment manufacturing industry independent innovation policy system, in the perfect policy system support, increasing investment in science and technology, strengthen the wire industry and crusher industry Reasonable docking, reduce the risk of innovation in the industry, for the crusher industry to provide a favorable space for independent innovation and development.


Shanghai Shibang Industry as a leading manufacturer of crusher industry, has been excellence, and actively develop new technologies to produce high quality and efficient counterattack crusher, cone crusher, European version of crusher series, tape conveyor, medium speed milling machine , Ball mill, etc., with excellent brand to lead the future of the crusher industry innovation and development path.
