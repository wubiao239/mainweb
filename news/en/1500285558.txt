World State Heavy Industries: market demand amplification, crusher industry ushered in the spring




Infrastructure has always been the focus of our national economic construction. In recent years, with the further development of China's economy and the 'Eleventh Five-Year' 'Twelfth Five-Year Plan' vigorously implemented, China's infrastructure construction is also everywhere. With the urbanization of the west, regional revitalization, high-speed railways, highways, nuclear power construction, affordable housing construction and investment in water investment, as well as local governments to maintain the sustainable development of local economy, planning, investment or New plans, new construction investment, the construction of these projects will inevitably bring a lot of sand and gravel demand, which gives the crusher industry has provided tremendous room for development, so that it has entered another development spring. At the same time, the demand for high quality gravel and gravel crusher manufacturers also put forward higher challenges. In recent years, the demand for the mining machinery market is strong, and the total industrial output value of the machinery industry has reached 1.689 billion yuan in 2011, an increase of 25% over the same period of last year, of which 102 kinds of major machinery products, 102 kinds of products to achieve growth, including mining machinery industry growth The fastest. China has entered the ranks of mining machinery production, consumption, export power, but big but not strong. This requires the crusher industry in the development of innovative technology to produce more and more perfect products to meet the second five during the mining machinery, mineral processing equipment, crusher equipment market continues to enlarge the demand. State State Industrial is a crusher, milling machine, sand making machine-based mining machinery and equipment manufacturing enterprises, over the years has been committed to the development of broken technology innovation and broken stone machine product improvement, research and development to create a jaw crushing Machine, European version of jaw crusher, impact crusher, the European version of the impact crusher, cone crusher, impact crusher and a series of advanced and efficient crusher equipment. These crushers are technically advanced, reliable, suitable for a wide range of fields and industries, as well as crushing, crushing, crushing and other crushing ranges, such as river pebbles, pebbles, granite, basalt, quartz, limestone and other rocks And the broken ore and stone production in the extraordinary performance by the majority of domestic and foreign customers permission and appreciation. At present, the state of industrial production crusher has been widely in the major stone plants and gravel plant in the production of gravel for China's infrastructure construction delivery of a large number of high quality sand and gravel material, and promote the further development of China's infrastructure construction.
