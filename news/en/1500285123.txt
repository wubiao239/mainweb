Introduction of Automatic Insurance and Unloading Function of Single Cylinder Cone Crusher



Shi Bang industry pointed out that the role of single-cylinder cone crusher in the role of ore crushing with spring-type cone crusher is basically the same, its main advantage lies in the automatic insurance and automatic uninstall function, the following is the World Trade Fair to specific :
First, automatic insurance; first into the accumulator into the nitrogen, the purpose is to make the pressure higher than the normal crushing pressure required for oil pressure. When the non-broken pieces such as iron into the crushing chamber, the high-pressure oil in the oil pressure is greater than the accumulator nitrogen pressure, the collector of the piston will be compressed nitrogen, hydraulic oil into the accumulator, the hydraulic cylinder Down, moving cone also will decline, this time the ore mouth increased, iron and other non-broken objects are excluded from the machine, to achieve the role of insurance.
Second, the automatic unloading: crusher in the normal mine work, sometimes failure or power failure and other accident parking, the crushing chamber was blocked ore, but the cone crusher does not allow the load to start, it needs to be unloaded. Remove the clogged ore, the use of hydraulic adjustment of the principle of drainage, when the crushing chamber is blocked, you can manipulate the hydraulic system, so that the cone moved up and down many times, which will be crushed and discharged ore, It greatly reduces the difficulty of artificial discharge.
The above is the state of the industry for single-cylinder cone crusher automatic insurance and unloading function of the introduction, the state industry pointed out that the single-cylinder cone crusher manufacturing process to achieve intelligent control, single-cylinder adjustment mechanism to adjust the equipment is very convenient, Automatic insurance and automatic unloading can easily remove the obstacles in the operation of the equipment, so as to improve the efficiency of crushing more, if you have more questions, please consult our customer service, we will give you a more detailed description.
