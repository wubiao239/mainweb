Shibang Heavy Industries: the recovery of railway construction to drive the rapid development of crusher industry



At present, the state of the railway construction and other projects to add policy support, starting from the beginning of March investment in infrastructure investment inflection point appears, cement production growth rebounded slightly, 1-3 month cumulative production of 398 million tons of cement, an increase of 7.32% Percentage points. Thus increasing the demand for raw materials for infrastructure construction. The state in order to promote economic development, put a lot of manpower, material resources to infrastructure projects, making cement, aggregate, steel, concrete, etc. become a tight product, not only pulling the crusher equipment industry's rapid development, and brought a grim The competition test the cement industry's warm recovery for the development of the crusher industry to create a good space environment.
China's infrastructure construction more and more attention, led the continuous progress of crusher equipment. Shibang industry as one of China's large crusher production enterprises, mainly jaw crusher (jaw crusher, jaw broken), cone crusher (conical broken), the European version of crusher, counterattack crusher Broken), etc., in the production process on the implementation of a variety of equipment models, equipment performance and stability is the mineral, cement, roads, hydropower construction and other areas of the ideal processing equipment.
In the infrastructure of the recovery opportunities, the state-owned industry always adhere to independent innovation research and development, is committed to product quality, service and brand competitiveness, focus on crusher equipment intelligent, pleasant and environmentally friendly energy-saving R \u0026 D and production, casting high-end brand Image, leading the mining machinery industry brand strategy for the development of railway construction to prepare.
