Mining machinery industry to change the future development prospects



The same time as the above-

Mining machinery as a branch of mechanical engineering disciplines, its development trend is digital, intelligent, ecological and pleasant. Mining machinery manufacturing industry should continue to integrate into the outstanding achievements of human beings in various fields, for the country's major economic construction needs, to the scientific concept of development as a guide to achieve sustainable development.


In the technical level of continuous improvement and diversification of market demand in the context of the promotion of China's mining machinery industry continues to develop. At present, from production-based manufacturing to service-oriented manufacturing has become an inevitable trend in the development of the manufacturing industry, mining machinery industry will also undergo a transformation of reform, so as to get better and more comprehensive development.


With the development of society and the development of national economy, human demand for resources and energy is growing, and China is a relatively poor resources of the country. With the development of resources, the depth of mining gradually increased from the land to the ocean, the conditions of resource exploitation deteriorated, the situation of safe mining is becoming more and more serious; China's coal mining depth has reached 1000m, the depth of metal mine reaches 1380m, , Groundwater, gas, high ground stress, geological structure to greatly increase the difficulty of resource extraction.


In order to improve the market competitiveness and profit, to further foster and nurture the healthy development of the manufacturing service industry in the manufacturing industry, the state has carefully researched and formulated effective industrial policies to guide more enterprises to actively carry out a wide range of production and manufacturing Service business activities. In the implementation process, not only can promote the transformation of enterprises to develop ways to improve efficiency and efficiency, and can speed up the value chain from the low end to the upstream and downstream extension, to achieve our country from the manufacturing power to the vision of manufacturing power.


With the modern manufacturing industry on the impact of economic development and industrial structure increased, a new round of economic structure will be adjusted, always grasp the situation dynamics, optimize the industrial structure, focusing on the integration of new technologies, innovative crusher equipment, casting the world brand, Within the independent reform, boost the mining machinery industry to the international development path.
