State World Heavy Industry tricyclic ultra-fine milling machine is committed to creating the first brand in the field of powder



The same time as the above-

With the rapid development of industrial production and manufacturing technology, China's mill industry gradually formed a variety, large-scale, with a certain level of technical structure of the system, has become an important pillar industry of the country's economy. Shanghai World State Heavy Machinery Co., Ltd. (CBBC Industry) as the field of milling powder experts, that with the upgrading of industrial technology and national construction efforts continue to increase, high fineness of the powder for industrial production The role of growing, high-grade milling machine is the future direction of development.


In this trend, the state state industrial milling machine experts in accordance with the mill for many years to master the ultrafine powder equipment processing technology, the traditional tricyclic medium speed mill application process in a variety of problems Thorough and thorough inspection and technological innovation, successfully developed with a high degree of fine production function of the three-ring speed mill. The tricyclic medium-speed mill equipment to learn from Sweden's advanced milling industry technology, for the current domestic mill industry trends and market demand trends, according to the use of a number of mill users and recommendations, professional ultra-fine powder Processing of the user and the development of a new type of milling equipment. The equipment in the actual production of the highest processing fineness can reach 3000 mesh, greatly broadening the scope of application of ultra-fine powder for metallurgical, building materials, chemicals, mining and other mineral materials, grinding, humidity below 6% of the Non-flammable non-explosive mineral materials processing, and set science and technology, innovation, quality, environmental protection in one, to meet the modern industry for ultra-fine powder requirements.


The new ultra-fine powder material has become the core of most of the industrial manufacturing upstream materials, covering almost all the light and heavy industry production and manufacturing sector. Three-ring speed mill as the ultra-fine powder material physical process of the most important equipment, with the ultra-fine powder materials in the economic production prospects continue to be optimistic, the state industry will gradually tricyclic Powder machine sales market to occupy more market share, to create the first brand of fine powder industry. In addition, the state of the production of a series of equipment series, impact crusher, jaw crusher, cone crusher, hammer crusher, drying equipment series equipment slime dryer, quartz sand dryer, the sea Sand dryer, etc., and milling equipment together to form a series of production lines, a variety of different minerals for one-stop processing. State Industries engineers will be based on the different requirements of customers design appropriate production line equipment, to achieve efficient, low carbon and reduce the cost of production purposes.
