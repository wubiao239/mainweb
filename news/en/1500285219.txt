What are the characteristics of the superfine grinder?



What are the characteristics of ultra-fine pulverizer? Superfine grinder generally material, crushing, slagging, support, transmission and other eight components, it through the duct to the crusher, powder classifier, product traps, fans and other connections into a closed or open circuit crushing two forms Dry crushing system. Here, the state state industry to introduce the characteristics of ultra-fine grinder:
First, the ultrafine grinder has two parallel crushing chamber, to achieve the effect of a two-stage crushing operation, in which the rotor in the first crushing chamber diameter than the second crushing chamber rotor diameter is small, radial blade. The two rotor blades in the first rotor blade and the spindle of the vertical angle of about 5 ° -15 ° between the direction of rotation to install, 2 rotor blades perpendicular to the spindle. In the leaves are fixed on the high hardness of the alloy made of spare blades, crushing chamber cylinder parallel to the opposite, leaving a small gap. Between the first pulverizing chamber and the second pulverizing chamber, the second pulverizing chamber and the fan chamber are separated by an adjusting ring. The two sets of blades, respectively, impact, grinding, shearing action and the impact of the collision counter to the common material crushing;
Second, the machine has a fully functional slagging system, the machine in the course of operation, can remove debris and residual in the machine is difficult to wear stone, is conducive to improving product quality, to ensure the normal production capacity of equipment to reduce the equipment parts Wear
Third, the product size can be through the aircraft air volume, cone and blade gap and other effects of regulation;
Fourth, the ultrafine grinder inside the machine is forced ventilation, can play a role in the role of classification and diffusion of heat;
Fifth, with the powder composition of a variety of systems, to meet the different requirements of a variety of minerals crushing.
The above is the state of the industry for the ultra-fine grinder operating characteristics of the introduction, if you have more questions, please consult our online customer service, we will give you a more detailed description.
