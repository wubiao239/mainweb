How to extend the service life of the cone crusher?



How to extend the life of the cone crusher? State Industries pointed out that the cone-type crusher parts of its own selection and structural design is reasonable, so its service life is relatively long. However, in practice, due to the operation of some technical staff is not standardized, thereby reducing the life of the cone crusher. Here, the state state industry to briefly introduce some of the considerations in the operation of the cone crusher:
First, the general mining companies in the mineralization will be used when the cone crusher to the original lump ore-based ore from the next fall directly under the cone crusher in the sub-ore plate, sub-ore plate wear quickly (3 months or so need to replace the new), if not replaced in time, fixed sub-ore 8 M30 bolts were all smashed ore, sub-ore plate off, resulting in cone crushing motor cone, fixed cone stuck, or even Burn the motor, the broken so the impact of production and parking, so the ore plate to be replaced regularly.
Second, to extend the life of the cone crusher, with 16 round steel welded into the outer diameter of φ300 ring, and then welding the ring up and down overlapping cross in the cone crusher sub-ore plate surface , In the production, sub-ore and the circle surrounded by the space filled with crushed ore, buffer the impact of the sub-ore plate, greatly extending the life of the sub-ore plate.
Above is the state of the industry from the point of view of the mine to extend the life of the two points made by the hope that we can attract the attention of enterprises. If you have more questions, please contact our customer service, we will give you a more detailed description.
