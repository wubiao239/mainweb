Increase investment in science and technology, Shibang heavy industry crusher to low input to achieve high value-added



The same time as the above-

At present, with the national economic development, the mining machinery industry as a pillar industry of the national economy, has also been developed by leaps and bounds. Crusher equipment as an important part of the mining machinery and equipment industry, broken processing equipment, large-scale, diversified, energy-saving, automation, will be the development trend of mining machinery and equipment. Analysis of this trend, as the domestic professional crusher equipment R \u0026 D manufacturers, the state industry recommended that China's crushing machinery manufacturing industry should use \\ 'second five \\' planning policy support opportunities to adjust the technical structure to speed up technological progress and Technological innovation, to promote the gradual realization of technology and equipment modernization.


In the 'second five' plan, the state of China and other crusher equipment manufacturing enterprises challenges and opportunities coexist, \\ 'second five \\' is our work on the last five years of the overall deployment and planning, involving people Production and life in all aspects, and the community is closely related to the national economic development policy-oriented role is self-evident, \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ One of the keys to market opportunities.


In order to realize the industrial structure adjustment and the technological content of the equipment, such as the crusher and other mining machinery and equipment, the state-owned industry has planned and purposefully introduced advanced technology and equipment at home and abroad. Through digestion and absorption, patent transfer and innovation work, Design and development capabilities to promote the realization of science and technology, and further narrow the gap with the international advanced level. To this end, the state-owned industry to establish a crusher technology development center, with a number of research institutions to increase investment in science and technology to improve the development of innovative capacity to solve a number of ore mining development has a significant impact on key technologies and equipment modernization issues, Improve the innovation capacity of equipment and products to promote new product development and upgrading of old products, to achieve low energy consumption, low emissions, high-tech content, high-quality, high value-added.


Shanghai Shi Bang industry has a wealth of technical precipitation and high-tech applications, with a professional talent, advanced technology, sophisticated equipment, improve the system, research and development capabilities to the domestic first-class. Shi Bang industrial production of the European version of jaw crusher, HPC hydraulic cone crusher, roller crusher, impact crusher and other equipment in the industry enjoyed a high reputation. \\ 'Twelve Five' for the state industry, is a rare opportunity for development, the state will be in accordance with the 'second five' plan guidelines, and actively promote the milling equipment, large-scale, diversified, energy- Automated development.


Since its inception, the state-industry always adhere to the 'integrity-based, customer first, Rende operation, Seiko manufacturing' business philosophy to 'become the leader in the mining industry' as the goal, innovation-oriented, Sustainable development of the road, continue to create better products and better service for customers to bring greater value for the development of mining machinery and equipment crusher force.
