Application of Shibang Heavy Industry Crusher in Shale Ceramsite




With the development of social economy, the construction industry has developed rapidly. Because of its small size, heavy weight, poor insulation performance, it is difficult to meet the needs of building development, and the development space of new building materials shale products is expanding , The earliest world famous American skyscrapers are all made of shale ceramsite raw materials.


Shale is a sedimentary rock, the composition of complex, but have a thin sheet or lamellar layer of the joints, mainly by the clay deposited by the pressure and temperature of the formation of rocks, but mixed with quartz, feldspar clinks and other chemicals Material, according to the composition of its mixture can be divided into: calcium shale, iron shale, siliceous shale, carbon shale, black shale, oil shale and so on. The use of shale ceramic as a light skeleton material, mixed with ceramic sand, slag or coal ash and other industrial waste, the use of cement as a cementing material, the production of products with light, heat, energy saving and so on. The use of the product as a building wall material, can achieve building energy efficiency.


Shale production of ceramsite is generally more commonly used method is: first, the shale burning expansion, and then burned shale shale to 4-20mm, after sieving into the rotary kiln into the finished product. Which burned shale crushing particle size related to the quality of ceramsite, the particles are generally the finer the better, the less the better the sediment. Burned shale broken with Shi Bang Industrial production of jaw crusher and impact crusher crushing after the fineness of just fine sediment is not large, the process flow chart is as follows:


China burned shale varieties, widely distributed, rich in resources. With shameless industrial jaw crusher, impact crusher and other crushing equipment processing broken shaving shale shale production of shale ceramic, no additives, simple process, less investment, build fast, low cost, good economic returns , Can produce ordinary shale ceramsite, can also produce ultra-light shale ceramsite, high-strength shale ceramsite, broken shale ceramsite, etc., can be widely used in the production of lightweight insulation materials, high-quality lightweight skeleton materials, Is the best choice for insulation materials.
