Shibang Heavy Industry Milling Machine Crusher Equipment Helps Mineral Waste Residue Green Low Carbon Recycling




With the deepening of the trend of economic globalization, low-carbon green economy in today's society has become the mainstream concept of development. As the domestic professional mining machinery R \u0026 D manufacturing business, Shanghai World State Heavy Machinery Co., Ltd. (referred to as state state industry) that crusher, milling machine and other mining machinery industry should also conform to the development of society, take the road of scientific development, Research and development of low pollution, low noise, energy efficient crusher, milling equipment, for the construction of resource-saving, environment-friendly, harmonious society and mankind to make more and greater contribution.


As the domestic crusher mill industry leader, the state since its inception has been committed to the development of environmental protection and energy conservation machinery and equipment. In the state of industry, the comprehensive recovery of fly ash, will be another way to alleviate the shortage of resources is an effective way. With the development of science and technology, for the recovery of fly ash products and equipment will be a breakthrough in innovation bottlenecks, and to achieve the maximum utilization of fly ash and coal gangue and create new value.


World state production of tricyclic medium speed milling machine and high pressure roller mill, strong ultra-fine milling machine, grinding ball mill, European version of jaw crusher, the European version of the impact crusher, hydraulic cone crusher, Impact crusher and other equipment is for the use of fly ash recycling of new mill and crusher equipment for domestic and foreign recycling of fly ash and coal gangue to provide the latest, efficient, energy efficient high-fine powder equipment. As the domestic has been devote themselves to research broken, grinding equipment and other mining machinery and equipment experts, the state of industrial R \u0026 D and manufacture of milling machines, crushers are widely used in chemical, mineral processing, coal, gypsum and other materials, ultra-fine powder and ultra-fine Powder processing, coal grinding operations is one of the most important equipment, called grinding a model.


Shibang Industrial production HGM tricyclic medium speed mill in the market test and customer feedback and R \u0026 D personnel continue to improve in the processing of various minerals, slag powder, a fly ash and other aspects of the effectiveness of the mill In the case of the same material, power, finished fineness, 40% higher than the output of the airflow mill and the stirring mill, and there is no problem that the bearing and its seal and the fragile screw are easy to loose and destroy the machine. In the case of the same fineness of finished materials and finished products, than the impact crusher wear parts long life, generally up to 1 year or more, it can be said that the series of powder grinder irreplaceable quality equipment.
