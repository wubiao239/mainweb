Mine machinery industry developed well into the green and the benefits of dual-core era



At present by the impact of domestic economic policy, product demand in the adjustment stage, but not change the future of the industry's long-term development prospects. China's current regional development is not balanced, the western development and other regional economic policy is to promote regional development of the balance. There are a large number of countries in the world for developing countries, infrastructure construction and other mining machinery market demand also has a broad space for development.
With the development of China's mining industry, the rapid development, and as a leading mining equipment, Shanghai World State Industrial since its inception always adhere to the development of the industry's leading technology and professional experience, and strive to develop and create a series of future-oriented quality, Environmental protection and energy saving first-class rotary crusher, formed a lot of complete production lines, such as: milling equipment production lines, production lines, sand production equipment production line, complete sets of equipment, lime cement complete sets of equipment five series of products. Widely used with various industries, and the recycling of resources made a great contribution.
To reduce the product production process and the use of the process of environmental pollution, has been committed to the product innovation and environmental protection, production of jaw crusher, impact crusher, cone crusher, hammer crusher, milling machine, sand Machine and other energy efficient reduction of crusher equipment, and strive to meet the interests of our customers under the premise of the moment, take the responsibility of environmental protection.
Increasing market demand, but also for the mining machinery industry to promote the power and foundation. In this era of the pursuit of high quality of life, green and benefits must be dual-core together to create a natural fresh living environment is the pursuit of modern high. Shanghai will continue to adhere to the path of innovation and development, enhance the technological content of products, technical performance, reliability and quality issues, to reduce energy consumption and environmental pollution, and strive to achieve the most green production, to achieve social and economic benefits The combination of the two, for the mining machinery industry to open up a sustainable development path.
