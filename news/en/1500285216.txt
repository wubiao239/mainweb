What is the process of vibration screening?



What is the process of vibration screening, the state industry pointed out that after the broken ore is a variety of different sizes of particles mixed together, in the use or further processing, often need to be divided into these ore particles close to the particle size Several levels. The use of porous work surface will be different particle size of the mixed material according to the size of its grading operations called sieve. Porous working surface is called sieve surface. A machine used for material classification with a sieve surface is called a sieve machine. Here, the state of the industry to make an introduction:
The simulated screening process includes primary sieving of raw ore, secondary sieving before firing, fine sieving of ferromagnetic and weak magnetic separation processes, and slagging in the process of magnetic separation. Their specific effect is: the ore after a screening, can be two kinds of products, namely, lump ore and powder. The lumps are subjected to secondary sieving and then routed into the shaft furnace for roasting. The fines are directly fed into the magnetic separation process. Spiral classifier, hydrocyclone are gravitational grading equipment, they are according to the law of subsidence classification, classification efficiency is low, generally 30% to 40%, especially the density of useful minerals often accumulated in the sand, Resulting in the smashing of useful minerals, reducing the mill handling capacity, increased power and metal consumption. So in a grinding and secondary grinding between the increase in fine sieve to reduce the grinding power consumption and metal consumption.
The above is the state of the industry for the process of vibration screening, if you have more questions, please consult our customer service, we will give you a more detailed description.
