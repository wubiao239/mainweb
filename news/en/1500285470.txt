Shibang Heavy Industry Crusher Accelerates High - end Application of Ore Resources



The same time as the above-

It is understood that with the economic globalization trend of continuous development, science and technology increasingly leaps and bounds, the future of China's crusher industry will improve the production and processing of crusher automation, information technology, intelligent level, the use of high-tech, advanced and practical technological transformation To continuously improve product quality, and promote the integration of information technology and industrialization. As a domestic professional crusher, milling machine equipment manufacturers, the state industry that the development of crusher industry will support new energy, new materials, new technologies, information technology, energy saving and environmental protection and other emerging industries, but also Accelerate the development of modern creation of deep processing industry, support the development of comparative advantages of labor-intensive; accelerate the elimination and update of high energy consumption, high pollution, serious consumption of backward products, the construction of resource-saving eco-market.


At present, China's crusher, mill market development is very rapid, China's rich mineral resources, but most of the way to sell raw materials, low prices, causing great obstacles to our economic development. With the rise of the crusher industry, led to the development of more new materials market, this series of development is inseparable from the national policy support, China strongly encourages private enterprises to participate in the market, issued 'building materials industry second Five-Year Plan 'To speed up the deep processing of non-metallic mineral resources, so that the crusher industry active, accelerate the development of high-end new building materials, and promote the national economy strong.


In response to the call of the state, do a good job in promoting economic development, the state industry actively explore crusher and other mining equipment, the latest production technology, and constantly increase scientific and technological innovation. Although the need for scientific research requires a lot of investment, but no scientific research strength is not competitive, product upgrading is one of the important signs of enterprise development. CBBC believes that companies only have the sense of continuous innovation and technology research and development in order to be in the market when the most needed to come forward in order to walk in the forefront of the crusher industry.


As a professional manufacturer of mining machinery crusher, the state-wide sales outlets throughout the country, the production of reliable product quality, durable, for the broken market, launched a crusher series products: impact crusher, the European version of crusher series , Hammer crusher, cone crusher, etc., leading the crusher world trend, for the high-end applications of ore resources to lay a solid foundation.
