Introduction of sand production line
Sand production line is usually composed of vibration feeder, jaw crusher, through impact crusher (sand making machine), vibrating screen, sand washing machine, tape conveyor, centralized electric control and other equipment, the design output is generally 50- 500T / H, our company has undergone several years of development research, will have the international advanced level through the impact crusher (sand making machine) and other products supporting the company to design a full set of sand production line, in the industry's leading position The


Sand production line process
Stone from the vibrating feeder evenly sent to the jaw crusher for rough, rough broken material into the jaw crusher to break again, broken material from the tape conveyor into the shaker for screening, To meet the sanding machine feed the degree of stone into the sand into the sand, do not meet the requirements of the return of fine jaw crusher re-broken from the sand out of the material, back to the shaker sieve, sieve Separated from the main requirements of the sand, into the sand washing machine cleaning, cleaning by the finished conveyor conveyor is finished, dissatisfied with the main requirements of the gravel mixed material, into the sand machine to break again, the production line eventually formed 2 off Closed loop, according to the needs of users can also be a variety of configurations.
