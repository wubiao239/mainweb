Impact crusher running a large amount of stone powder how to do



The impact crusher is mainly the use of the rotor inside the rotor rotation, driving the hammer to crack the collision stone to the final break, the stone under the action of the collision of each other to form a large stone whirlpool, increase the collision between the material. In this process, the rotor quickly turn, the larger the amount of air, small stone will spill, causing dust pollution. In addition to the rotor to bring out a large number of air flow, so that the stone powder fly out, and its broken material is mainly through the crushing chamber through the multi-level crushing and grinding to complete the material is broken fineness smaller, in the course of running, Powder is easy to fly out. In addition, it works mainly through the beat broken to complete, will increase the amount of dust, as well as counterattack plate for a long time the impact will be worn, and even worse, the board will fall on the situation, this will cause a counterattack Machine seal greatly reduced, increasing dust pollution.
In order to solve the situation of the large amount of stone powder in the work of the counter crusher, the user may use the dust removal equipment, or the enclosed cover, and may add the amount of water before the material enters the counter- Wet or directly with the dust humidifier with the work. In addition, the user can regularly check the parts of the equipment, such as the liner, the machine shell seal and the device at the connection of the screw is loose and other checks on the machine to do regular maintenance and repair, will greatly reduce the dust Quantity, and also improve work efficiency.
Impact crusher is the more commonly used mine, it is from the shell, or the machine inside the counterattack plate and the rotor are made of high strength chromium alloy material, the service life is longer, the other part of the convergence is better, are objective to reduce The amount of dust.
