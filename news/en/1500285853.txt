Jaw crusher in different areas of outstanding performance



China's wide range of applications is also widely used, crusher widely used in mining, smelting, building materials, roads, railways, water conservancy and chemical industry and many other departments. At present, there are counterattack crusher, hammer crusher, impact crusher, roller crusher, composite crusher, series and so on. With a large crushing ratio, product size uniformity, simple structure, reliable, easy maintenance, operating costs and other economic characteristics.
Water conservancy construction industry
In order to meet the fragmentation of artificial sand and gravel material, in the equipment technology, through the jaw crusher is the stone of the primary crushing production equipment for continuous technical upgrading, from the beginning of the traditional jaw crusher, the development of today's largest advanced technology The PE1200 * 1500 jaw crusher, which provides high quality aggregate for hydropower projects, offers a 30% increase in production compared to conventional equipment at the same power level, and a stable feed, broken structure No dead zone, greatly improving the feed capacity and production, and its crushing ratio, product size uniformity, very good to meet the needs of the production of gravel material. The same time as the above-
Mining Coal Industry
In view of the heavy pollution of coal enterprises and high energy consumption and other issues, the state of the industry in the continuous innovation and development, transformation and improvement of the process, to enhance the technical content of crusher equipment, production of high efficiency composite crusher, the use of flexible adjustment Institutions, effective control of the material size, innovative design, simple structure, energy efficient and environmentally friendly features such as coal gangue, fly ash and other medium hardness materials in the crushing operations play a miraculous. Therefore, the construction of a strong and competitive machinery industry is the necessary choice to realize the modernization of our country. The revitalization and development of machinery industrialization are inseparable from the gradual development of China's economic power.
Chemical coatings industry
With the continuous development of the crusher industry, but also gradually affect the chemical industry, the main fertilizer, pesticides, new areas of fine chemicals, inorganic salts, organic raw materials, rubber processing, chlor-alkali, chemical and other new materials and other national economic status, chemical industry materials are generally special , There are flammable and explosive, there is a sticky, there is a corrosive, there is extremely hard, there is a special disparity in texture and so on, so the single particle crushing mechanism of the basis of the mechanism of crushing behavior and crushing mechanism research often from the single Broken pieces of particles to start. At present, China has continuously developed and updated, the development of crusher equipment to meet the needs of different users, industrial crusher equipment can be applied to different areas and can play a major role in the performance of excellence.
